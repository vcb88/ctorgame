## Known MVP Blockers

### Critical Issues
1. Type System
   - ✅ Core type consolidation complete
   - ✅ Server-side types migrated and validated
   - ✅ Replay and history system implemented
   - 🔄 Client code needs update to new types

2. Error Handling
   - Inconsistent error formats
   - Missing error recovery for critical scenarios
   - Incomplete error logging

3. Connection Management
   - Unreliable reconnection in some cases
   - Incomplete session recovery
   - Missing timeout handlers

### Infrastructure Issues
- Redis connection stability needs improvement
- Basic backup strategy needed for MVP
- Health check system needs refinement

## Current Focus

### Immediate Tasks
1. Update client code to use shared types
   - ActionQueue.ts
   - ErrorRecoveryManager.ts
   - GameStateManager.ts
2. Implement basic error handling
3. Improve connection reliability
4. Add critical path tests
5. Document client-side changes

### Short-term Tasks
1. Enhance state recovery
2. Implement basic monitoring
3. Add essential validations
4. Improve error reporting
5. Update deployment guide

## Branch Status

   - Focus on core functionality
   - Maintain basic reliability
   - Minimize feature scope
   - Document essential parts
   - Test critical paths

2. Known Limitations
   - Manual type synchronization required
   - Basic error handling only
   - Limited test coverage
   - Minimal monitoring
   - Simple backup strategy
