# Current Development Status

## Overview
The project is now at version 0.3.0, focusing on integrating advanced features from the legacy codebase while maintaining stability and improving user experience. Key focus areas include AI capabilities, flexible board sizes, and enhanced position analysis.

## In Progress
1. AI Service Implementation
   - Base infrastructure created
   - Initial position evaluation
   - Move analysis framework
   - Test coverage started

2. Legacy Features Integration
   - Documentation of valuable features completed
   - Type definitions for AI and analysis created
   - Initial service structure established
   - Integration plan developed

## Completed Features

### Replacement Mechanics Analysis
The replacement mechanism exhibits a deterministic cascade effect with the following properties:

1. **Monotonic Progress**
   - Each replacement converts an opponent's piece to the player's piece
   - Player's pieces are only added, never removed during replacements
   - The number of player's pieces can only increase during the replacement phase

2. **Order Independence**
   - The order of replacements does not affect the final board state
   - If a replacement becomes possible at any point during the cascade, it will remain possible
   - The final state after all cascading replacements is deterministic

3. **Cascade Process**
   - Each replacement can enable new replacements by adding player's pieces
   - The process continues until no more replacements are possible
   - This creates a "wave" effect where replacements can trigger chains of further replacements

This deterministic nature means that prioritizing certain replacements over others would not affect the final game state, making the replacement order optimization unnecessary.

### Core Game Functionality
