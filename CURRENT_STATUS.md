# Current Development Status

## Overview
The project is currently at version 0.1.0 (stable), focusing on establishing a solid foundation with improved type safety, build system compatibility, and development environment setup. Key focus areas include infrastructure stability, type system improvements, and development workflow optimization.

## Recent Improvements

### 1. Type System Enhancements
- Enhanced type safety for game state and events
- Improved connection and error type definitions
- Added explicit type assertions for critical components
- Synchronized client and server type definitions
- Implemented type guards for data validation

### 2. Build System and Compatibility
- Added CommonJS build support for shared module
- Improved build compatibility across environments
- Fixed template literal issues in JSX
- Enhanced module import compatibility
- Streamlined development builds

### 3. Development Environment
- Configured Vite dev server with nginx proxy
- Improved healthcheck system
- Enhanced MongoDB security and initialization
- Optimized development workflow
- Added comprehensive error handling

## Core Game Functionality

### Game Mechanics
- 10x10 toroidal board implementation
- Two operations per turn (first turn exception)
- Automatic piece replacement with deterministic cascade
- Score tracking with type-safe implementation
- Enhanced player identification system
- Turn management with isFirstTurn flag

### Infrastructure
- WebSocket integration with Socket.IO
- MongoDB with authentication for game history
- Redis for real-time state management
- NPZ file format for detailed game data
- Full TypeScript support
- Docker containerization

### Development Tools
- Vite development server with HMR
- Nginx reverse proxy configuration
- Health monitoring for all services
- Comprehensive build system
- Development environment containers

## Known Issues

### Shared Types Status

The project currently maintains duplicate shared type definitions in client/src/shared.ts and server/src/shared.ts. This is a temporary solution during the MVP phase to allow rapid development. These files need to be manually synchronized when making changes to shared types.

Key considerations:
- All changes to shared types must be applied to both files
- WebSocket event types must match exactly
- Game state and player types must be identical
- Error types and enums must be consistent

Future plans include consolidating these files into a shared package, but during the MVP phase, manual synchronization is required to maintain type safety.

### Development Environment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Build optimization for production needs review
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Development environment documentation needs update
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some type definitions need consolidation

### Infrastructure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Redis connection resilience needs improvement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è MongoDB backup strategy not implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Health check thresholds need tuning

### Code Quality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some components need type safety improvement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test coverage needs expansion
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error handling needs standardization

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete type system consolidation
2. Improve development environment documentation
3. Standardize error handling
4. Enhance service health monitoring
5. Expand test coverage

### Short-term Goals
1. Redis connection resilience
2. MongoDB backup implementation
3. Production build optimization
4. Type definition cleanup
5. Health check improvements
