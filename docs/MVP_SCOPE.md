# MVP Scope and Limitations

This document outlines what features are included in MVP and what is intentionally postponed for later stages.

## Error Handling System

### Included in MVP
- Base error types and interfaces
- Basic error recovery strategies
- Simple retry mechanism
- Error notification system
- Integration with GameStateManager
- Basic state recovery
- Critical error handling

### Postponed Features
- Comprehensive testing
- Advanced recovery strategies
- UI error display system
- Error analytics and reporting
- Complex retry patterns
- State version control
- Error history
- Offline error handling

### Rationale
The MVP focuses on handling critical errors that could break game functionality. Advanced features like analytics, comprehensive testing, and sophisticated UI are not critical for demonstrating core gameplay and can be added later.

## State Management

### Included in MVP
- Basic state persistence
- Simple state validation
- State recovery for critical errors
- Local storage integration
- Basic error handling
- State synchronization with server

### Postponed Features
- State versioning
- State migration system
- Complex state validation
- State history
- Time travel debugging
- State snapshots
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced state persistence

### Rationale
The MVP implements essential state management features needed for basic gameplay. Advanced features like versioning, history, and debugging tools would improve development experience but are not critical for demonstrating core functionality.

## Component Architecture

### Included in MVP
- Basic component isolation
- Simple state propagation
- Essential error handling
- Basic loading states
- Core game components

### Postponed Features
- Component testing
- Performance optimization
- Advanced component patterns
- Error boundary system
- Component documentation
- Storybook integration
- Accessibility features
- Animation system

### Rationale
MVP focuses on core game components and basic architecture patterns. Advanced patterns, comprehensive testing, and developer tools can be added after core functionality is proven.
