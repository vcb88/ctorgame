# Type System Documentation

## Overview

The project is in the middle of a major type system refactoring effort. The main goals are:
- âœ… Simplify type hierarchy
- âœ… Remove type duplication
- âœ… Move from inheritance to composition
- ðŸ”„ Improve type safety (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ Make the system more maintainable (in progress)

## Type System Architecture

### Principles
- Composition over inheritance
- Immutable interfaces (readonly properties)
- Domain-driven design
- Single source of truth for types
- Clear dependency hierarchy

### Import Order
1. core/primitives.js
2. geometry/types.js
3. game/types.js
4. game/moves.js
5. game/state.js
6. game/players.js
7. network/* files
8. validation/* files

## Known Issues and Type Duplications

### Critical Issues

1. Type System Compilation
   - Maximum call stack size exceeded error during compilation
   - Potential circular dependencies in type resolution
   - Mixed usage of old and new type systems
   - Duplicate type definitions causing conflicts

2. Testing Coverage
   - Limited test coverage for new types
   - Missing integration tests
   - Event validation needs testing

3. Documentation
   - Some sections need updating
   - Missing examples for new features
   - Migration guides incomplete

4. Validation
   - Runtime validation incomplete
   - Missing schema validation
   - Error messages need improvement

### Type Duplications Being Resolved

1. Position/Coordinate Types:
   - Old: IXCoordinate, IYCoordinate (core.ts)
   - New: IPosition (geometry/types.ts)

2. Dimension Types:
   - Old: IWidth, IHeight (core.ts)
   - New: ISize (geometry/types.ts)

3. Game State Types:
   - Old: IGamePhaseBase extends IPhase (base.ts)
   - New: Direct union type GameStatus = 'waiting' | 'playing' | 'finished'

4. Operation Types:
   - Old: IOperationTypeBase extends IOperationType (base.ts)
   - New: Direct union type OperationType = 'place' | 'replace'

5. Validation Types:
   - Old: IValidationResult (core.ts)
   - New: IMoveValidation (game/types.ts)

   - Replaced Player enum with PlayerNumber type

     * @ctor-game/shared/types/core/* â†’ @ctor-game/shared/src/types/core/*.js

## Migration Progress (2025-01-14)

Last PR: Consolidated WebSocket handlers (gameHandlers.ts â†’ GameServer.events.ts)
Current task: Migrating client types, starting with game.d.ts

Dependencies to watch:
1. game.d.ts updates might affect:
   - useGame hook
   - useMultiplayerGame hook
   - GameStateManager
   - Game components using turn state

Next steps:
1. Review and merge game.d.ts changes
2. Migrate animations.ts (remove enum)
3. Merge errors.ts files
4. Update gameManager.ts
   - [ ] Document type system architecture

## Notes

- When migrating files, always make backups first
- Test compilation after each file migration
- Check for circular dependencies
- Update documentation as you go
- Keep both old and new versions until testing is complete
