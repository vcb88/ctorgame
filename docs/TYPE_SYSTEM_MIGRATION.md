### Breaking Changes

See the detailed list in the Breaking Changes section of the original document.

### Known Issues

1. Critical: Type System Compilation
   - Maximum call stack size exceeded error during compilation
   - Potential circular dependencies in type resolution
   - Mixed usage of old and new type systems
   - Duplicate type definitions causing conflicts

2. Testing Coverage
   - Limited test coverage for new types
   - Missing integration tests
   - Event validation needs testing

3. Documentation
   - Some sections need updating
   - Missing examples for new features
   - Migration guides incomplete

4. Validation
   - Runtime validation incomplete
   - Missing schema validation
   - Error messages need improvement

### Current Investigation Plan (2025-01-14)

1. Type System Analysis [IN PROGRESS]
   - [ ] Map all remaining .ts and .new.ts files
   - [ ] Document import/export relationships
   - [ ] Identify all type duplications
   - [ ] Create dependency graph for remaining old types

2. Immediate Tasks
   - [ ] Create list of all duplicate type definitions
   - [ ] Document all circular dependencies
   - [ ] Map type usage in all modules
   - [ ] Plan safe removal of old type system

3. Validation Steps
   - [ ] Test compilation with each type removal
   - [ ] Verify no new circular dependencies
   - [ ] Check all dependent modules
   - [ ] Update affected documentation
