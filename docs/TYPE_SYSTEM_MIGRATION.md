# Type System Migration Status

## Current Status

The project is in the middle of a major type system refactoring effort. The main goals are:
- Simplify type hierarchy
- Remove type duplication
- Move from inheritance to composition
- Improve type safety
- Make the system more maintainable

### Completed Changes

1. Core Types (`shared/src/types/core/base.ts`)
   - Basic primitive types
   - Game-related types
   - Strict typing with literal types
   - Readonly properties for immutability

2. GameService (`server/src/services/GameService.new.ts`)
   - Migrated to new type system
   - Improved error handling
   - Better type safety
   - Simplified state management

3. GameLogicService (`server/src/services/GameLogicService.new.ts`)
   - Removed enum dependencies
   - Simplified move validation
   - Added type guards
   - Improved game state handling

4. WebSocket Handling (`server/src/websocket/`)
   - New event type system
   - Strict typing for all events
   - Improved error handling
   - Better configuration management

5. Redis Integration (`server/src/services/RedisService.new.ts`)
   - New Redis type system
   - Improved lock management
   - Better state versioning
   - Event cleanup system

### Pending Tasks

1. EventService Migration
   - [ ] Create new event types
   - [ ] Implement type-safe event handling
   - [ ] Add event validation
   - [ ] Improve event queueing
   - [ ] Add event persistence

2. Client-Side Types
   - [ ] Update client state management
   - [ ] Migrate React components to new types
   - [ ] Update WebSocket client handlers
   - [ ] Add client-side type guards

3. Data Validation
   - [ ] Create validation schemas for new types
   - [ ] Add runtime type checking
   - [ ] Improve error messages
   - [ ] Add validation utilities

4. Testing Updates
   - [ ] Update unit tests for new types
   - [ ] Add type testing
   - [ ] Update integration tests
   - [ ] Add more type guards tests

5. Documentation
   - [ ] Update API documentation
   - [ ] Add type system documentation
   - [ ] Update migration guide
   - [ ] Add code examples

### Migration Strategy

1. File Organization
   ```
   shared/src/types/
   ├── core/           # Core primitive types
   │   ├── base.ts    # Basic types
   │   └── models.ts  # Domain models
   ├── game/          # Game-specific types
   ├── network/       # Network/WebSocket types
   └── storage/       # Database/Cache types
   ```

2. Type Migration Process
   1. Create new type file
   2. Add types using composition
   3. Create new service version
   4. Add tests
   5. Update documentation
   6. Mark old version as deprecated

3. Dependencies
   - New types should have minimal dependencies
   - Use composition over inheritance
   - Keep type hierarchy flat
   - Use type intersections when needed

## Breaking Changes

1. Enum Replacements
   ```typescript
   // Old
   enum Player { First = 1, Second = 2 }
   
   // New
   type PlayerNumber = 1 | 2;
   ```

2. State Structure
   ```typescript
   // Old
   interface IGameState extends IGameStateBase {
       board: IBoard;
       currentTurn: ITurnState;
   }
   
   // New
   interface IGameState {
       board: Array<Array<PlayerNumber | null>>;
       turn: {
           currentPlayer: PlayerNumber;
           moves: IGameMove[];
       };
   }
   ```

3. Event System
   ```typescript
   // Old
   interface IGameEvent extends ITimestamp {
       type: string;
       data: unknown;
   }
   
   // New
   type GameEvent =
       | { type: 'move'; move: IGameMove; state: IGameState }
       | { type: 'join'; player: IPlayer }
       | { type: 'end'; winner: PlayerNumber | null };
   ```

## Post-Migration Tasks

1. Cleanup
   - [ ] Remove deprecated types
   - [ ] Remove unused imports
   - [ ] Clean up test files
   - [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline

2. Performance
   - [ ] Analyze type compilation time
   - [ ] Optimize type imports
   - [ ] Reduce type complexity
   - [ ] Add type caching where possible

3. Documentation
   - [ ] Create type usage guide
   - [ ] Document best practices
   - [ ] Add migration examples
   - [ ] Update API documentation

4. Monitoring
   - [ ] Add type coverage reporting
   - [ ] Monitor build times
   - [ ] Track type-related issues
   - [ ] Add type validation in CI

## Notes

1. Backward Compatibility
   - Old types are kept but marked as deprecated
   - Migration can be done gradually
   - Breaking changes in next major version

2. Type Safety
   - All new types are strictly typed
   - Added runtime type guards
   - Improved error messages
   - Better type inference

3. Performance Considerations
   - Simplified type hierarchy
   - Reduced type recursion
   - Better tree-shaking
   - Optimized imports

4. Known Issues
   - Some circular dependencies remain
   - Legacy code still uses old types
   - Some tests need updating
   - Documentation needs revision

## Next Steps

1. Immediate
   - Create issues for remaining tasks
   - Prioritize critical components
   - Plan testing strategy
   - Update development guide

2. Medium Term
   - Complete EventService migration
   - Update client-side code
   - Improve test coverage
   - Update documentation

3. Long Term
   - Remove deprecated types
   - Full migration completion
   - Performance optimization
   - Release new major version
