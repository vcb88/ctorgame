# Deployment Guide

TODO: Full deployment documentation

## Current Deployment Options

### Docker Deployment
The project includes Docker configuration for deployment:
- `Dockerfile` for production build
- `docker-compose.yml` for production setup
- `Dockerfile.dev` for development
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` for local development

### Infrastructure Requirements
Based on README and code:
- PostgreSQL database (not implemented yet)
- Redis for session management (not implemented yet)
- Nginx for reverse proxy
- Node.js environment

## Known Infrastructure Gaps

1. Database Setup
   - PostgreSQL configuration missing
   - Migration scripts needed
   - Backup procedures needed

2. Caching Layer
   - Redis configuration missing
   - Cache invalidation strategy needed

3. Load Balancing
   - Nginx configuration needs review
   - WebSocket connection handling in load balanced environment

TODO: Add detailed deployment procedures, including:
- Environment variables
- Security considerations
- Monitoring setup
- Backup procedures
- Scaling guidelines
