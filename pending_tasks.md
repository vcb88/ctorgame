  - [x] Add validation for replay and history events

- [x] Type System Clean Up
  - [x] Remove duplicate constants.ts and enums.ts
  - [x] Migrate all .new.ts files to their base versions
  - [x] Keep .ts.old files temporarily for backup

- [ ] Client Code Migration
  - [ ] Update ActionQueue.ts to use shared types

- Advanced monitoring
- UI animations and effects
- Sound effects
- Mobile optimization
- Settings panel
- Advanced statistics

## Documentation Review Checklist
- [ ] Review and update:
  - [ ] README.md - getting started guide
  - [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md - development workflow
  - [ ] CURRENT_STATUS.md - implementation status
  - [ ] API_WEBSOCKET_V2.md - latest API changes
  - [ ] GAME_MECHANICS.md - current rules
  - [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md - system structure

## Required Testing (MVP Minimum)
- [ ] Basic WebSocket connection tests
- [ ] Game state management tests
- [ ] Move validation tests
- [ ] Score calculation tests

## Implementation Guidelines
- Focus on core gameplay functionality
- Maintain basic reliability
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Verify documentation matches implementation
- Test critical paths only
